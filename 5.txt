this file is just for fun as I like to use "touch" command and add multiple files by using just one command
the reason for this file is completly random
we'll just see how it goes further while training

btw. I'm reading about different functionalities, like for example permanent file removal which worked onec I learned about it
but on the other day - which is today - it doesn't seem to be working
so propbably the reason for this file is to do waht?
to remove xD

of course I will try to keep the tracking regarding this note, but it will be on seperate branch and will be included in different commit
